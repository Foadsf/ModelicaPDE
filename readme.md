# Why?!

When I started using Modelica a couple of years ago I though that I have finally found the single platform to do all my simulation. Obviously I couldn't be more wrong. As a mechanical engineering we deal with a lot of simulations which include continuous systems with partial differential equations governing the system. You would assume that this should be solved problem but apparently there is nothing but a lot of questions asked in different forums, none answered properly. So I making this repository out of frustration to collect all the available examples I can find anywhere on the internet. Plus all the relevant publications, all the questions ask in different forums and other useful resources.

#### To be investigated:
1. strange folder in OpenModelica repository named pde: https://openmodelica.org/svn/OpenModelica/tags/TAG_MATHCORE_ABB_1/
2. what is "AxialConduction": https://build.openmodelica.org/Documentation/Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer.html
