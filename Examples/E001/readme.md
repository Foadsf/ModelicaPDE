This example addresses solving heat equation in a one dimensional rod using finite difference numerical method (second order central difference). The rod has two constant low temperature and high temperature ending, hence a one dimensional partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary condition.
To run this simulation you may use OpenModelica GUI.
